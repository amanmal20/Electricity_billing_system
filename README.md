# Electricity_billing_system
This Java project, which gathers information from our power metre, is a modern spin on the traditional electricity billing system. The main goal of this project is to automate the entire procedure in order to make it efficient, convenient. The software has the ability to calculate the bill amount based on the monthly electricity consumption.
